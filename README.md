## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **`posts.js`** contains a list of available blog posts (title, date, and file path).
2. **`script.js`** dynamically loads posts into the homepage and fetches Markdown content when a post is opened.
3. **Markdown files** inside `/posts` hold the actual blog content.
4. **Images** can be placed in `/images` or referenced by URL directly in the Markdown file.

Example `posts.js` entry:

```javascript
const posts = [
  {
    title: "Creating Consistent Design Systems",
    date: "2025-08-15",
    file: "posts/design-systems.md",
    image: "images/example-image.jpeg"
  }
];
```

Example Markdown (`design-systems.md`):

```markdown
# Creating Consistent Design Systems for Web Applications

![](/images/example-image.jpeg)

A design system is more than just a style guide...
```
